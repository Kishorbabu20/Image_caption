### **Project Overview: Image Captioning using VGG16 and LSTM**

#### **Description:**
This project implements an **image captioning system** that generates descriptive text for images using a combination of deep learning techniques. It leverages the **VGG16** pre-trained convolutional neural network for image feature extraction and a custom-built **LSTM-based decoder** for natural language generation.

#### **Key Features:**
1. **Feature Extraction with VGG16:**
   - The VGG16 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, is used to extract high-dimensional image features from input images.
   - The fully connected (penultimate) layer's output (4096-dimensional) is used as the image representation.

2. **Text Preprocessing and Tokenization:**
   - Captions associated with each image are preprocessed by converting text to lowercase, removing special characters, and tokenizing.
   - Start (`startseq`) and end (`endseq`) markers are added to each caption.

3. **Vocabulary Building:**
   - A tokenizer is used to construct a vocabulary from the training captions, ensuring that only relevant words are retained.
   - Padding is applied to create uniform sequence lengths for captions.

4. **Custom Encoder-Decoder Architecture:**
   - **Encoder**: Processes image features and maps them to a dense representation.
   - **Decoder**: Uses an embedding layer, LSTM, and dense layers to generate captions word-by-word.
   - Combines image and sequence features using a fusion layer.

5. **Data Generator:**
   - A batch-wise data generator is implemented to handle large datasets, preventing memory issues.

6. **Training with Cross-Entropy Loss:**
   - The model is trained using the categorical cross-entropy loss function and optimized with Adam.

7. **Inference for Caption Generation:**
   - Captions are predicted iteratively by generating one word at a time until the `endseq` token is produced.

#### **Usage:**

1. **Dataset Preparation:**
   - Place all images in a directory (`BASE_DIR/Images`).
   - Provide a text file (`captions.txt`) mapping image filenames to their captions.

2. **Running the Pipeline:**
   - Extract image features using VGG16 and save them as a pickle file.
   - Preprocess captions and generate vocabulary.
   - Train the encoder-decoder model.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Configure training parameters such as the number of epochs and batch size.
   - Start training using the provided data generator.

4. **Generating Captions:**
   - Use the `generate_caption` function to predict captions for new images.
   - Visualize images with their predicted captions using Matplotlib.

#### **Configuration:**

1. **Dependencies:**
   - Python Libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, tqdm, Pillow, pickle.
   - Pre-trained Model: VGG16 from `tensorflow.keras.applications`.

2. **Directory Structure:**
   ```
   BASE_DIR/
   ├── Images/           # Folder containing input images
   ├── captions.txt      # File mapping images to captions
   ├── storage/          # Folder to save features and model
   ```

3. **Hyperparameters:**
   - Embedding size: 256
   - LSTM units: 256
   - Dropout rate: 0.4
   - Batch size: 32
   - Epochs: 20

4. **Output:**
   - **Trained Model**: Saved as `best_model.h5`.
   - **Generated Captions**: Displayed along with the input image.

#### **How It Works:**
1. **Training:**
   - Extract visual features using VGG16.
   - Combine visual features with tokenized captions.
   - Train the LSTM-based decoder to predict the next word in a sequence.

2. **Caption Generation:**
   - Provide a new image.
   - Extract its features using VGG16.
   - Generate a caption by predicting the next word sequentially until `endseq` is reached.
